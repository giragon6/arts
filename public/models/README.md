# 3D Models Directory

## Required Files

### dart.glb
Place your dart 3D model file here as `dart.glb`. The model should be:
- A realistic dart with tip, shaft, and fletching
- Properly scaled (will be scaled to 0.1x in code)
- Optimized for web display
- Format: GLTF Binary (.glb)

If no GLB file is present, the application will fall back to using geometric shapes to create a dart.

## Model Requirements
- File format: .glb (GLTF Binary)
- Reasonable polygon count (< 1000 triangles recommended)
- Textures embedded in the GLB file
- Proper orientation (pointing along positive Z-axis)
